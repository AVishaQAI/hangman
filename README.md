## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The aim is to provide a command-line interface where users can guess letters of a randomly selected word. Through developing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of Python basics, especially in terms of class-based structures and string manipulation.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Hangman game, you will need a Python interpreter (version 3.x is recommended). No additional dependencies are required as the game utilizes only standard Python libraries.

1. **Prerequisite**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. **Download**: Clone or download the source code from this repository.
3. **Execution**: Run the script using Python.

## Usage Instructions

After starting the application, the game will randomly select a word from a predefined list. The player is then prompted to guess letters one at a time.

- **Starting the Game**: Execute the script using a Python interpreter.
- **Playing the Game**: Enter a single letter when prompted and receive feedback on your guess.
- **End Game Conditions**: The game ends when either the word is completely guessed or the number of lives reaches zero.
- **Adding words**: you can add words to the word bank in the varibile word_list. This will make the game more challening and fun!

## File Structure

- `milestone_5.py`: The main Python script containing the Hangman class and game logic.
